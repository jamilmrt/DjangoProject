Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving field that focuses on creating machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI technologies are integrated into various industries, such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment, enhancing efficiency and innovation. Machine learning, a subset of AI, enables systems to learn from data and improve over time without explicit programming. As AI continues to advance, it raises important ethical considerations regarding privacy, job displacement, and decision-making transparency. Ultimately, AI holds the potential to transform society in profound ways.
